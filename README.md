**Growth Mindset** is putting in the effort to to develop a skill knowing that you are able to do it through constant hard work and a positive attitude.

- Keep on going even though you feel stuck, you will get there within time.
- Stop thinking you are not capable of doing things when you are.
- Do not compare your self to others and ask for their help. 

> Don’t worry about failure. Worry about the chances you miss when you don’t even try.
