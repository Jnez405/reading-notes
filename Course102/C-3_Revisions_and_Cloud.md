# Version Control
**Version Control** is like a time-travel system for files. It helps you go back to previous versions, see changes, and fix mistakes easily. It's a tool that lets you keep track of how files evolve over time and collaborate with others more efficiently.

`Local Version Control`

- In local version control, changes are tracked on an individual's local machine.
- A database on the local machine keeps a record of file changes and versions.
- It's useful for personal projects or when working alone.
- Popular systems include RCS (Revision Control System) and tools like Git for local repositories.

`Centralized Version Control`

- In centralized version control, a central server stores the master copy of the project's files.
- Developers work on their local copies, and changes are committed to the central server.
- It facilitates collaboration among team members but relies on a central server.
- Examples include CVS (Concurrent Versions System) and SVN (Subversion).

`Distributed Version Control`

- In distributed version control, every developer has their own complete repository with the project's entire history.
- Changes can be made locally, and collaboration can occur without a central server.
- Git is a widely used distributed version control system that allows for efficient collaboration and flexibility.
