# C-2_Coders_Computer
A coder's computer has a varity of tools that they use to perform their job efficiently and effectivly, and one essential tool that you will use is the **Text-Editor** 

## Text-Editor
A **Text-Editor** is a software application that allows users to create and edit plain text files. It provides a simple interface for typing and manipulating text, commonly used for writing and editing code. Notepad is a good example of a basic text-editor that provides the basic features needed for coding but, there are better alternatives that offer more features tailored for a coder. Features like syntax highlighting, code completion, Extensions, Themes, are what set basic text editors and coding-specific text editors apart, but what if you want more? then your next tool is the IED which stands for "Integrated Development Environment". A IED has a text editor, compiler, debugger, and other features that help with coding, testing, and debugging.

##Important Features for Text Editor

- Code Completion

  Code completion is a helpful feature in coding tools that automatically suggests and completes your code as you type.

- Syntax Highlighting

Syntax highlighting is a feature in coding tools that uses different colors and fonts to visually distinguish and emphasize various elements of your code. It helps make the code more readable by highlighting keywords, variables, comments, and other components, making it easier for developers to understand and spot errors.

- Extensions

- Themes
