## Text-Editor: The Basic, The Coding-Specific, and The IDE
A coder's computer has a varity of tools that they use to perform their job efficiently and effectivly, and one essential tool that you will use is the **Text-Editor**. A **text editor** is a software application used for creating and editing plain text files, with Notepad being a basic example that provides essential features for coding. However, for more advanced capabilities tailored to coding needs, there are better alternatives that offer features like syntax highlighting, code completion, extensions, and themes. If you find yourself needing more comprehensive tools, the next step is transitioning to an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which combines a text editor, compiler, debugger, and other features to streamline coding, testing, and debugging processes.


## Important Features for Text Editor

- **Code Completion**

  Code Completion is a helpful feature in coding tools that automatically suggests and completes your code as you type.

- **Syntax Highlighting**

  Syntax Highlighting uses colors to distinguish code elements.

- **Extensions**

  Extensions are additional tools that enhance a text editor's functionality.

- **Themes**

  Themes customize the visual appearance of the editor.

`pwd`: Prints the current working directory, showing the full path of the directory you are currently in.

`ls`: Lists the files and directories in the current directory.

`cd`: Changes the current directory. You can use it to move to a different directory.

`mkdir`: Creates a new directory (folder).

`touch`: Creates an empty file or updates the access and modification time of an existing file.

The following commands navigate to a "projects" directory, create a new subdirectory "new-project" inside it, create an empty file "newfile.md" within "new-project," move back to the parent directory, and finally, list the contents of the "new-project" directory.

  
`cd projects`: Changes the current directory to the "projects" directory.

`mkdir new-project`: Creates a new directory named "new-project" inside the "projects" directory.

`touch new-project/newfile.md`: Creates a new empty file named "newfile.md" inside the "new-project" directory.

`cd ..`: Moves up one level to the parent directory.

`ls projects/new-project`: Lists the contents of the "new-project" directory within the "projects" directory, which should display the "newfile.md" file.
