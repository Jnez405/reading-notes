### Domain Modeling

#### Why We Need Domain Modeling
- **Purpose**: Domain modeling helps in understanding and organizing the problem space of a given domain by creating a visual representation of its key concepts, entities, and relationships.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Clarity**: Provides a clear understanding of the domain and its boundaries.
  - **Communication**: Facilitates better communication among stakeholders, including developers, business analysts, and domain experts.
  - **Consistency**: Ensures that all team members have a consistent understanding of the domain.
  - **Foundation for Development**: Serves as a foundation for designing and implementing the system, ensuring that it aligns with the domain requirements.

### HTML Table Basics

#### Why Should Tables Not Be Used for Page Layouts?
- **Accessibility Issues**: Tables used for layout purposes reduce accessibility for visually impaired users as screen readers interpret the tags, making it difficult for users to navigate.
- **Complex Markup**: Layout tables create complex and hard-to-maintain markup compared to using CSS layout techniques.
- **Responsiveness**: Tables are not automatically responsive, requiring additional effort to adapt to different screen sizes, whereas CSS layout techniques offer better responsiveness.

#### Semantic HTML Elements in an HTML `<table>`
1. **`<table>`**:
   - **Description**: Defines the entire table structure.
   - **Usage**: Used to enclose all table-related elements.
2. **`<tr>`**:
   - **Description**: Represents a row in the table.
   - **Usage**: Used to group cells (`<td>` or `<th>`) into rows.
3. **`<th>`**:
   - **Description**: Defines a header cell in the table.
   - **Usage**: Used for cells that act as headers for a row or column, providing context for the data cells.

### Introducing Constructors

#### What is a Constructor and Advantages of Using It?
- **Constructor**:
  - **Definition**: A special function used to initialize objects in a class. In JavaScript, constructors are defined within classes using the `constructor` keyword.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Initialization**: Allows setting initial values for object properties.
  - **Reusability**: Promotes code reusability by enabling the creation of multiple instances of a class with the same structure and behavior.
  - **Encapsulation**: Encapsulates object creation logic, making the code more organized and maintainable.

#### `this` in Object Literals vs. Constructors
- **Object Literal**:
  - **Context**: `this` refers to the object itself.
  - **Example**: In `{ name: 'Alice', greet() { console.log(this.name); } }`, `this` refers to the object `{ name: 'Alice' }`.
- **Constructor**:
  - **Context**: `this` refers to the instance of the object created by the constructor.
  - **Example**: In `function Person(name) { this.name = name; }`, `this` refers to the instance of `Person`.

### Object Prototypes Using a Constructor

#### Explain Prototypes and Inheritance via an Analogy
- **Analogy**: Consider a factory that produces cars.
  - **Prototype**: The blueprint of a car model, defining common features (e.g., wheels, engine).
  - **Inheritance**: Each car produced by the factory inherits features from the blueprint but can have additional features or customizations.
- **Prototypes in JavaScript**:
  - **Prototype**: Each function in JavaScript has a `prototype` property, which is an object shared by all instances created by the constructor.
  - **Inheritance**: When an object is created using a constructor function, it inherits properties and methods from the constructor's prototype.

#### Example:
- **Constructor Function**:
  ```javascript
  function Car(model) {
    this.model = model;
  }
  Car.prototype.start = function() {
    console.log(this.model + ' is starting');
  };
  ```
- **Creating Instances**:
  ```javascript
  const car1 = new Car('Toyota');
  const car2 = new Car('Honda');
  
  car1.start(); // Toyota is starting
  car2.start(); // Honda is starting
  ```
- **Explanation**:
  - `car1` and `car2` inherit the `start` method from `Car.prototype`.
  - Changes to `Car.prototype` affect all instances, demonstrating prototype-based inheritance.
