# Debugging and Error Handling

**Key Points:**
1. **Common JavaScript Errors:**
   - **Syntax errors:** Mistakes in the code that prevent it from running.
   - **Runtime errors:** Issues that occur when the code is executed.
   - **Logical errors:** Code runs but doesn’t produce the expected result.

2. **Debugging Tools and Techniques:**
   - Using browser developer tools to inspect errors.
   - `console.log()` for printing variable values and debugging logic.
   - Breakpoints for stopping code execution at specific points to examine state.
   - The `debugger` statement to pause code execution.

3. **Understanding Error Messages:**
   - Reading and interpreting error messages to identify and fix issues.
   - Common error message formats and what they indicate (e.g., line numbers, error type).

4. **Testing Code:**
   - Writing small, manageable pieces of code and testing them incrementally.
   - Using automated tests to catch errors early.

**Notes and Code Samples:**
- **Syntax Error Example:**
    ```javascript
    // Syntax Error: Missing closing parenthesis
    console.log("Hello, world!";
    ```
- **Runtime Error Example:**
    ```javascript
    // Runtime Error: `myVar` is not defined
    console.log(myVar);
    ```
- **Logical Error Example:**
    ```javascript
    // Logical Error: Incorrect multiplication
    let result = 2 + 2; // Should be 2 * 2
    console.log(result); // Outputs 4 instead of 8
    ```
- **Using `console.log()` for Debugging:**
    ```javascript
    let a = 5;
    let b = 10;
    console.log("Value of a: ", a); // Debugging variable `a`
    console.log("Value of b: ", b); // Debugging variable `b`
    ```
- **Using Breakpoints and the `debugger` Statement:**
    ```javascript
    function calculateSum(x, y) {
        debugger; // Execution will pause here
        return x + y;
    }
    calculateSum(5, 10);
    ```

### Reading Questions

**What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript**

**1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.**
- **Syntax Error:** These are mistakes in the code that prevent it from running. They occur when there is a typo or incorrect syntax in the code, such as a missing parenthesis or incorrect keyword usage. Syntax errors are usually caught by the JavaScript engine during the compilation phase, and

 the code will not execute until the error is fixed.
  - **Example:** 
    ```javascript
    console.log("Hello, world!";
    ```
- **Logic Error:** These occur when the code runs without any syntax issues, but it doesn't produce the expected result. This happens due to incorrect logic or faulty algorithms within the code. Logic errors are harder to detect because the code executes but yields unintended outcomes.
  - **Example:** 
    ```javascript
    let result = 2 + 2; // Should be 2 * 2
    console.log(result); // Outputs 4 instead of 8
    ```

**2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**
1. **Syntax Errors:** 
   - Encountered missing semicolons and unmatched parentheses. Corrected by carefully reading the error messages and fixing the syntax issues highlighted by the JavaScript engine.
   - **Correction:** Ensured that all statements ended with semicolons and all parentheses were properly closed.
2. **Runtime Errors:**
   - Encountered issues with undefined variables or trying to access properties of null or undefined objects.
   - **Correction:** Added checks to ensure variables were defined and objects were properly initialized before accessing their properties.
     ```javascript
     if (myVar !== undefined) {
         console.log(myVar);
     }
     ```
3. **Logic Errors:**
   - Encountered problems with incorrect calculations or unexpected behavior in loops.
   - **Correction:** Used `console.log()` to print variable values at different stages of execution and stepped through the code to identify where the logic went wrong. Adjusted the code to correct the logic.
     ```javascript
     let result = 2 * 2;
     console.log(result); // Outputs 4, as expected
     ```

**3. How will this topic continue to influence your long-term goals?**
- Understanding and troubleshooting JavaScript errors is fundamental to becoming a proficient developer. Mastering debugging techniques will improve problem-solving skills, leading to more efficient and effective coding practices. This will ultimately contribute to building more robust and reliable applications, aligning with long-term goals of becoming an expert in software development and creating high-quality software solutions.

**The JavaScript Debugger**

**1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**
- The JavaScript Debugger is a powerful tool built into modern browsers that allows developers to inspect and debug their JavaScript code. It helps identify and fix errors by pausing the execution of the code at specific points, allowing developers to examine the state of the program (e.g., variable values, the call stack). The debugger provides features like breakpoints, watch expressions, and call stack inspection to facilitate the debugging process.

**2. Define what a breakpoint is.**
- A breakpoint is a marker set in the code where the debugger will pause the execution of the program. This allows developers to examine the current state of the application, including variable values and the call stack, to understand the behavior of the code at that specific point. Breakpoints are essential for debugging because they help isolate issues and verify that the code is working as expected.

  ```javascript
  function calculateSum(x, y) {
      debugger; // Execution will pause here if the debugger is open
      return x + y;
  }
  calculateSum(5, 10);
  ```

**3. What is the call stack?**
- The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the sequence of function calls in a program. It records the active functions and their order of execution. When a function is called, it is added to the top of the stack, and when the function returns, it is removed from the stack. The call stack helps developers trace the execution path and understand the context of the current function, making it easier to debug issues related to function calls and execution flow.

  ```javascript
  function firstFunction() {
      secondFunction();
  }

  function secondFunction() {
      thirdFunction();
  }

  function thirdFunction() {
      console.log("Hello, world!");
  }

  firstFunction();
  ```

  - In this example, the call stack would look like this:
    1. `firstFunction()`
    2. `secondFunction()`
    3. `thirdFunction()`
    - When `thirdFunction()` completes, it is removed from the stack, and the stack unwinds back to `secondFunction()` and then `firstFunction()`.
