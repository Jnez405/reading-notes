# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

#### Reading: JavaScript Object Basics

1. **Describing an Object to a Non-Technical Friend**:
   - An object is like a box that holds related information and actions about something. For example, a "car" object might contain information like the color, brand, and model, as well as actions like starting the engine or honking the horn.

2. **Advantages of Creating Object Literals**:
   - Object literals are simple and easy to understand.
   - They group related data and functions together, making code more organized.
   - Object literals provide a clear structure and improve code readability.

3. **Difference Between Objects and Arrays**:
   - Objects store data as key-value pairs, where each key is unique.
   - Arrays store data in an ordered list, accessed by numerical indices.
   - Objects are used to represent more complex structures, while arrays are used for ordered collections.

4. **Using Bracket Notation**:
   - Bracket notation is needed when property names are dynamic or not valid identifiers (e.g., names with spaces or starting with numbers).
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const obj = { 'first name': 'John' };
     console.log(obj['first name']); // John
     ```
   
5. **Evaluating `this` in Code**:
   - The `this` keyword refers to the object it belongs to.
   - In the example code, `this` refers to the `dog` object.
   - Advantage: `this` allows methods to access other properties of the same object.
     ```javascript
     const dog = {
       name: 'Spot',
       age: 2,
       color: 'white with black spots',
       humanAge: function (){
         console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age * 7} in human years`);
       }
     }
     dog.humanAge(); // Spot is 14 in human years
     ```

#### Reading: Introduction to the DOM

1. **What is the DOM?**
   - The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.
   - It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
   - The DOM represents the document as a tree of objects.

2. **Relationship Between the DOM and JavaScript**:
   - JavaScript interacts with the DOM to manipulate web pages.
   - Through JavaScript, you can add, remove, or modify elements and their attributes in the DOM.

#### Bookmark and Review: Understanding the Problem Domain

1. **Understanding the Problem Domain**:
   - The problem domain is the area of knowledge or activity that needs to be understood to solve a problem.
   - It's often considered the hardest part of programming because it requires a deep understanding of the subject matter and the specific problem at hand.

#### Primitive Values vs. Object References in JavaScript

1. **Primitive Values**:
   - Examples: numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, and symbols.
   - Primitive values are immutable, meaning their value cannot be changed once set.

2. **Object References**:
   - Objects are reference types, meaning the variable contains a reference to the location in memory where the object is stored.
   - Unlike primitives, objects are mutable, and their properties can be modified after creation.
